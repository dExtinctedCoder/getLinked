## Project Overview

In this coding challenge, I have created a project that leverages the provided Figma design and integrates data from the Backend API to deliver a user-friendly and visually appealing web application.

## Features

- **Design Implementation**: I have meticulously implemented the design elements from the [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/5WXTnOu1Yy7vjCDCGKSnib/Getlinked?type=design&node-id=3-9&mode=design&t=hNNBgARNvalItDWS-0), ensuring that the layout, color schemes, and typography closely match the design.

- **API Integration**: The project seamlessly integrates with the [Backend API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13489492/2s9YC5zYA5) to retrieve real-world data, which is presented in an easy-to-understand format for users.

- **Creativity**: I have added innovative features to make my project stand out and showcase my creativity.

- **Documentation**: My code includes comprehensive documentation to assist other developers in understanding how the project works.

- **Testing**: Thorough testing has been performed to ensure the project functions as expected, with minimal bugs or errors.
